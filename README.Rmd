## Overview

This project is dedicated to retrieve, clean and check GBIF occurrences for all fish species of the World (n = 35,035 species). Occurrences are aggregated at the ecoregion level (Spalding _et al._, 2007) for marine species and at the drainage basin level (Tedesco _et al._, 2017) for freshwater species.

## Data sources

This project uses the following databases:

| Database        | Usage                                        | Reference                 | Link   |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------ | :----: |
| Fishbase        | Get fish species accepted names              | Froese R & Pauly D (2000) | [link](https://www.fishbase.se/) |
| GBIF            | Get fish occurrences at World scale          | GBIF.org (2024)           | [link](https://www.gbif.org/)    |
| MEOW            | Aggregate occurrences for marine species     | Spalding _et al._ (2007)  | [link](https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/marine-ecoregions-of-the-world-a-bioregionalization-of-coastal-and-shelf-areas) |
| Drainage basins | Aggregate occurrences for freshwater species | Tedesco _et al._ (2017)   | [link](https://figshare.com/collections/A_global_database_on_freshwater_fish_species_occurrences_in_drainage_basins/3739145) |

A comprehensive description of all these databases is available [here](https://github.com/phenofish/gbif-ecoregions/blob/main/data/README.md).



## Workflow

The analysis pipeline follows these steps:

1. Find GBIF accepted names & identifiers from Fishbase accepted names
2. Download GBIF occurrences
3. Clean and check GBIF occurrences
4. Intersect occurrences w/ marine ecoregions layer (marine species)
5. Intersect occurrences w/ drainage basins layer (terrestrial species)
6. Export layers in [`outputs/`](https://github.com/phenofish/gbif-ecoregions/blob/main/outputs)
7. Compute marine and freshwater species richness
8. Export barplots and maps in [`figures/`](https://github.com/phenofish/gbif-ecoregions/blob/main/figures)


## Content

This repository is structured as follow:

- [`DESCRIPTION`](https://github.com/phenofish/gbif-ecoregions/blob/main/DESCRIPTION): contains project metadata (authors, description, license, dependencies, etc.).

- [`make.R`](https://github.com/phenofish/gbif-ecoregions/blob/main/make.R): main R script to set up and run the entire project. Open this file to follow the workflow step by step.

- [`R/`](https://github.com/phenofish/gbif-ecoregions/blob/main/R): contains R functions developed especially for this project.

- [`data/`](https://github.com/phenofish/gbif-ecoregions/blob/main/data): contains raw data used in this project. See the [`README`](https://github.com/phenofish/gbif-ecoregions/blob/main/data/README.md) for further information.

- [`analyses/`](https://github.com/phenofish/gbif-ecoregions/blob/main/analyses): contains R scripts to run the workflow. The order to run these scripts is explained in the [`make.R`](https://github.com/phenofish/gbif-ecoregions/blob/main/make.R) and the description of each script is available in the header of each file.

- [`outputs/`](https://github.com/phenofish/gbif-ecoregions/blob/main/outputs): contains the outputs of the project. See the [`README`](https://github.com/phenofish/gbif-ecoregions/blob/main/outputs/README.md) for a complete description of the files.

- [`figures/`](https://github.com/phenofish/gbif-ecoregions/blob/main/figures): contains the figures used to validate et visualize the outputs. See the [`README`](https://github.com/phenofish/gbif-ecoregions/blob/main/figures/README.md) for a complete description of the figures.



## Installation

To install this compendium:

- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) 
this repository using the GitHub interface.
- [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) 
your fork using `git clone fork-url` (replace `fork-url` by the URL of your fork). 
Alternatively, open [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) 
and create a New Project from Version Control.



## Usage

Launch the [`make.R`](https://github.com/phenofish/gbif-ecoregions/blob/main/make.R)
file with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
source("make.R")
```

**Notes**

- All required packages listed in the [`DESCRIPTION`](https://github.com/phenofish/gbif-ecoregions/blob/main/DESCRIPTION) file will be installed (if necessary)
- All required packages and R functions will be loaded
- Each script in [`analyses/`](https://github.com/phenofish/gbif-ecoregions/blob/main/analyses) can be run independently
- Some steps listed in the [`make.R`](https://github.com/phenofish/gbif-ecoregions/blob/main/make.R) might take time (days and days)
